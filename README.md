# GENESIS Protocol — Cryptographic Hash Certificate (Locked: May 4, 2025)

This repository contains a timestamped SHA-256 hash certificate for the GENESIS Protocol archive (`GENESIS.zip`), authored by Érico Lisboa.

The GENESIS Protocol is a pre-deployment, multi-layer behavioral coordination system engineered to counteract entropy in decentralized environments. This certificate publicly affirms the integrity and authorship of the original architecture.

## 🔐 Purpose

- Establish public authorship prior to institutional or digital deployment.
- Create an immutable timestamp of the protocol's cryptographic fingerprint.
- Ensure traceability of conceptual originality and protocol integrity.

## 📄 Contents

- `Genesis-Certificate.txt`: The cryptographic hash (SHA-256) of the complete GENESIS Protocol archive, locked and signed on May 4, 2025.

## ❗ Statement of Integrity

Any future fork, clone, or conceptual derivative must trace back to this certificate for authenticity. The system was designed as an indivisible whole; partial adoption constitutes structural dilution.
