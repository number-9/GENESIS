GENESIS Protocol — Cryptographic Hash Certificate  
--------------------------------------------------

Archive:        GENESIS.zip  
Hash Type:      SHA-256  
Hash Value:     368227181ad08664d53ccf55f3b420da65c66297a3feb82515b1e1ea9b04a209

Date of Lock:   May 4, 2025  

Hash Scope:     Full contents of GENESIS.zip at time of lock  
                Includes all source materials, conceptual models, and encoded frameworks.  
                Establishes authorship and intellectual primacy over:  
                - Foundational equations governing time, entropy, and systemic coherence  
                - A symbolic-to-mathematical validation architecture  
                - A triadic behavioral proof mechanism  
                - A field-adaptive meta-layer coordination system  
                - A singular vibrational rite marking protocol activation  
                - A unifying energetic principle underlying transformation

Statement of Intention:  
This hash serves as a cryptographic fingerprint of the complete GENESIS system  
prior to any public or institutional exposure.  
Any future derivation, fork, or attempted replication without matching this fingerprint  
is deemed a conceptual dilution or entropy artifact.
